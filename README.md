The goal of this mapping project is to assess the current pedestrian, bicycle, and transit access to parks in these neighborhoods along the LA River and analyze plans for future access to the Bowtie. The mapping files are open source and available on the Learn More tab for anyone interested in exploring more about park access or advocating for thoughtful and well-connected open space.
